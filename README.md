## About:

The data used in this analysis comes from  [California Independent System Operator Corporation (CAISO)](http://www.caiso.com/green/renewableswatch.html) renewables watch reports, which aggregates raw grid data from electricity producers in California.
An hourly breakdown of total production by resource type is given for Renewables (including Solar, Thermal, Solar, Wind, Small Hydro, Biogas, Biomass, and Geothermal), Nuclear, Thermal, Imports, and Hydro within the ISO grid.
Throughout this project, we clean and aggregate data into useable forms, perform exploratory data analysis, analyzing daily average renewables generation by source, as well as and exploring seasonality/time series trends with custom functions and `dplyr`.
